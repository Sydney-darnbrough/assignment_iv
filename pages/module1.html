<h1><u>MODULE I: Confounding Tools</u></h1>

<h3>Reading Discussion I: Tool Standards and Poetics</h3>
<p><em><strong> 1. The two articles both articulate an ethical problem related to their topic (industry-standard design tools & the current scale and state of open-source tech). Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other? </strong></em></p>

<p>The article from eye magazine covers how adobe and apple have become the industry standard but have progressed in such a way where they seem to prioritize profits over actually creating and helping to fuel creativity. The second article from Jacobin focuses more on microsoft and their focus on having more accessible software that people can manipulate and use them to their desire more freely. these two articles overlap in their ideas of accessible design tools. both articles argue that these tools can and should be easily accessible. </p>
    <em><strong>2. Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?</strong></em></p>
<p>I personally see creativity to be an integral skills outside of the numerous digital tools available because with creativity you can make something out of anything.</p>
